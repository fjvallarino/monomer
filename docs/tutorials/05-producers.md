# Producers

Related to Tasks, Monomer also provides the concept of Producers. Both serve the
purpose of being able to run arbitrary IO code, but while Tasks only return a
single result, Producers allow sending an unlimited number of events back to the
application. This makes them useful for consuming streams of data, as needed to
implement a chat application or a stock ticker.

## Creating a producer

In the example, probably the simplest stream of data is consumed: the current
time.

The producer is created when the application starts by responding with a
Producer to the init event. Producer takes a function slightly different to what
is provided to Task:

- It receives a function as an argument. This function is provided by the
  library and is used for sending messages back to the application.
- It has () return type, meaning the only way of sending information to the
  application is through the function provided as argument.

```haskell
handleEvent wenv node model evt = case evt of
  AppInit -> [Producer timeOfDayProducer]
  AppSetTime time -> [Model $ model & currentTime .~ time]

timeOfDayProducer :: (AppEvent -> IO ()) -> IO ()
timeOfDayProducer sendMsg = do
  time <- getLocalTimeOfDay
  sendMsg (AppSetTime time)
  threadDelay $ 1000 * 1000
  timeOfDayProducer sendMsg
```

In the example the producer requests the current time, sends a message using the
provided function, waits for one second (`threadDelay` uses nanoseconds) and,
finally, calls itself recursively to repeat the process for as long as the
application runs.

Once the event is received, the application updates its model as usual.

You can check the [Ticker](../examples/03-ticker.md) example to see a websocket
based Producer.

## New widgets

### Animation

In the example, every ten seconds the time label will _flash_. This effect is
generated by the `animFadeIn` animation, which is restarted with that frequency.
The way to start/restart an animation is by sending it a message. This requires
the widget key of the target plus the expected message.

```haskell
fadeInMsg time
  | truncate (todSec time) `mod` 10 /= 0 = []
  | otherwise = [Message "fadeTimeLabel" AnimationStart]
```

In the case of
[animFadeIn/animFadeOut](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/monomer/docs/Monomer-Widgets-Animation-Fade.html)
(there is also
[animSlideIn/animSlideOut](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/monomer/docs/Monomer-Widgets-Animation-Slide.html)),
the possible messages are:

- AnimationStart: Causes the animation to start from the beginning.
- AnimationStop: Causes the animation to stop if currently running.

Messages are not only used for animation purposes, as other widgets can receive
messages to perform custom operations. For example, scroll can receive
`ScrollTo Rect`, to make sure a specific part of its content is visible. Each
widget that supports messages has them documented in their Haddock page.
