  -- | Mouse wheel movement. Includes mouse position, move size in both axes and
  --   wheel direction.
  | WheelScroll Point Point WheelDirection
  -- | Keyboard key action. Includes modifiers, keyCode and pressed/released.
  --   This event should not be used for text input.
  | KeyAction KeyMod KeyCode KeyStatus
  -- | Processed keyboard events. Some Unicode characters require several key
  --   presses to produce the result. This event provides the final result.
  | TextInput Text
  -- | Provides current clipboard contents to a requesting widget.
  | Clipboard ClipboardData
  -- | Target now has focus. Includes path of the previously focused widget.
  | Focus Path
  -- | Target has lost focus. Includes path of the next focused widget.
  | Blur Path
  -- | Mouse has entered the assigned viewport.
  | Enter Point
  -- | Mouse has moved inside the assigned viewport. This event keeps being
  --   received if the main mouse button is pressed, even if the mouse is
  --   outside the assigned bounds or even the screen.
  | Move Point
  -- | Mouse has left the assigned viewport. This event is not received until
  --   the main mouse button has been pressed.
  | Leave Point
  -- | A drag action is active and the mouse is inside the current viewport. The
  --   messsage can be used to decide if it applies to the current widget. This
  --   event is not received by the widget which initiated the drag action.
  | Drag Point Path WidgetDragMsg
  -- | A drag action was active and the main button was released inside the
  --   current viewport.
  | Drop Point Path WidgetDragMsg
